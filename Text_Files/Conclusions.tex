\label{chap:conclusion}

% Introduced new clifford simulation method
% Also extended work on classical simulation
% Good memory scaling makes simulating larger circutis w/ small nc count v accessible
% If chi grows at most polynomially, these meet the definition of a poly-box => classical simulability
% However, most methods look at multiplicative scaling and are inherently super-polynomial even if small
% More work needed on decompositions
% Qassim et al doing some intersting work on reducing extent in multiple operations
% Noise is a big unknown
% Simulator is inherently pure state only, can support noise via stochastic sampling but still big overhead
% Interesting to consider extensions e.g. s-rank of positive pure state decomposition?
% Link to robustness from regula for pure states
