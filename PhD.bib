abstract = {Recent work has explored using the stabilizer formalism to classically simulate quantum circuits containing a few non-Clifford gates. The computational cost of such methods is directly related to the notion of stabilizer rank, which for a pure state {\$}\backslashpsi{\$} is defined to be the smallest integer {\$}\backslashchi{\$} such that {\$}\backslashpsi{\$} is a superposition of {\$}\backslashchi{\$} stabilizer states. Here we develop a comprehensive mathematical theory of the stabilizer rank and the related approximate stabilizer rank. We also present a suite of classical simulation algorithms with broader applicability and significantly improved performance over the previous state-of-the-art. A new feature is the capability to simulate circuits composed of Clifford gates and arbitrary diagonal gates, extending the reach of a previous algorithm specialized to the Clifford+T gate set. We implemented the new simulation methods and used them to simulate quantum algorithms with 40-50 qubits and over 60 non-Clifford gates, without resorting to high-performance computers. We report a simulation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in which we process superpositions of {\$}\backslashchi\backslashsim10{\^{}}6{\$} stabilizer states and sample from the full n-bit output distribution, improving on previous simulations which used {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}3{\$} stabilizer states and sampled only from single-qubit marginals. We also simulated instances of the Hidden Shift algorithm with circuits including up to 64 T gates or 16 CCZ gates; these simulations showcase the performance gains available by optimizing the decomposition of a circuit's non-Clifford components.},

abstract = {Imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order. In order to find someone's phone number with a 50{\%} probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

abstract = {As quantum computers of non-trivial size become available in the near future, it is imperative to develop tools to emulate small quantum computers. This allows for validation and debugging of algorithms as well as exploring hardware-software co-design to guide the development of quantum hardware and architectures. The simulation of quantum computers entails multiplications of sparse matrices with very large dense vectors of dimension {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$}, where {\$}n{\$} denotes the number of qubits, making this a memory-bound and network bandwidth-limited application. We introduce the concept of a quantum computer $\backslash$textit{\{}emulator{\}} as a component of a software framework for quantum computing, enabling a significant performance advantage over simulators by emulating quantum algorithms at a high level rather than simulating individual gate operations. We describe various optimization approaches and present benchmarking results, establishing the superiority of quantum computer emulators in terms of performance.},

abstract = {A unitary t-design is a set of unitaries that is "evenly distributed" in the sense that the average of any t-th order polynomial over the design equals the average over the entire unitary group. In various fields -- e.g. quantum information theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on matrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices to sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This results in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent unitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford group. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a 4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which the Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for various applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex signal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true 4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor power of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the 4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer code -- a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error correction codes. The action of the Clifford group on this stabilizer code can be decomposed explicitly into previously known irreps of the discrete symplectic group. We give various constructions of exact complex projective 4-designs or approximate 4-designs of arbitrarily high precision from Clifford orbits. Building on results from coding theory, we give strong evidence suggesting that these orbits actually constitute complex projective 5-designs.},

abstract = {Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t){\^{}}c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.},

abstract = {It is an oft-cited fact that no quantum code can support a set of fault-tolerant logical gates that is both universal and transversal. This no-go theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however, is the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that work directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit and 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable method of code switching.},

We introduce such a universal model that employs a d-dimensional ancillary qudit. The ancilla-register interactions take the form of controlled displacements operators, with a displacement operator defined on the periodic and discrete lattice phase space of a qudit. We show that these interactions can implement controlled phase gates on the register by utilizing geometric phases that are created when closed loops are traversed in this phase space. The extra degrees of freedom of the ancilla can be harnessed to reduce the number of operations required for certain gate sequences. In particular, we see that the computational advantages of the quantum bus (qubus) architecture, which employs a field-mode ancilla, are also applicable to this model. We then explore an alternative ancilla-mediated model which employs a spin ensemble as the ancillary system and again the interactions with the register qubits are via controlled displacement operators, with a displacement operator defined on the Bloch sphere phase space of the spin coherent states of the ensemble. We discuss the computational advantages of this model and its relationship with the qubus architecture.},

abstract = {Graph states form a rich class of entangled states that exhibit important aspects of multi-partite entanglement. At the same time, they can be described by a number of parameters that grows only moderately with the system size. They have a variety of applications in quantum information theory, most prominently as algorithmic resources in the context of the one-way quantum computer, but also in other fields such as quantum error correction and multi-partite quantum communication, as well as in the study of foundational issues such as non-locality and decoherence. In this review, we give a tutorial introduction into the theory of graph states. We introduce various equivalent ways how to define graph states, and discuss the basic notions and properties of these states. The focus of this review is on their entanglement properties. These include aspects of non-locality, bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement and its classification in terms of the Schmidt measure, the distillability properties of mixed entangled states close to a pure graph state, as well as the robustness of their entanglement under decoherence. We review some of the known applications of graph states, as well as proposals for their experimental implementation.},

abstract = {With the current rate of progress in quantum computing technologies, 50-qubit systems will soon become a reality. To assess, refine and advance the design and control of these devices, one needs a means to test and evaluate their fidelity. This in turn requires the capability of computing ideal quantum state amplitudes for devices of such sizes and larger. In this study, we present a new approach for this task that significantly extends the boundaries of what can be classically computed. We demonstrate our method by presenting results obtained from a calculation of the complete set of output amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 27 in a 2D lattice of {\$}7 \backslashtimes 7{\$} qubits. We further present results obtained by calculating an arbitrarily selected slice of {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}37{\}}{\$} amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 23 in a 2D lattice of {\$}8 \backslashtimes 7{\$} qubits. Such calculations were previously thought to be impossible due to impracticable memory requirements. Using the methods presented in this paper, the above simulations required 4.5 and 3.0 TB of memory, respectively, to store calculations, which is well within the limits of existing classical computers.},

This causes the cost of the synthesis to depend more strongly on the relative (rather than absolute) precision required. We analyze the mean and variance of the T-count required to use our techniques and show that, with high probability, the required T-count will be lower than lower bounds for the T-count required to do ancilla--free circuit synthesis.

This generalization leads to protocols with novel properties and is needed to push forward new schemes of computation based on them. Port-based teleportation protocols and our generalizations use a large resource state consisting of N singlets to teleport only a single qubit state reliably. We provide two distinct protocols which recycle the resource state to teleport multiple states with error linearly increasing with their number.

In this context the T gate has a special status since it confers universal computation when added to the (classically simulable) Clifford gates. However it can be very expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. We therefore view this gate as a resource which should be used only when necessary. Given an n-qubit unitary U we are interested in computing a circuit that implements it using the minimum possible number of T gates (called the T-count of U). A related task is to decide if the T-count of U is less than or equal to m; we consider this problem as a function of N=2{\^{}}n and m. We provide a classical algorithm which solves it using time and space both upper bounded as O(N{\^{}}m poly(m,N)). We implemented our algorithm and used it to show that any Clifford+T circuit for the Toffoli or the Fredkin gate requires at least 7 T gates. This implies that the known 7 T gate circuits for these gates are T-optimal. We also provide a simple expression for the T-count of single-qubit unitaries.},

abstract = {Teleportation is a crucial element in fault-tolerant quantum computation and a complete understanding of its capacity is very important for the practical implementation of optimal fault-tolerant architectures. It is known that stabilizer codes support a natural set of gates that can be more easily implemented by teleportation than any other gates. These gates belong to the so called {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} hierarchy introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature $\backslash$textbf{\{}402{\}}, 390). Moreover, a subset of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} gates, called semi-Clifford operations, can be implemented by an even simpler architecture than the traditional teleportation setup (Phys. Rev. $\backslash$textbf{\{}A62{\}}, 052316). However, the precise set of gates in {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} remains unknown, even for a fixed number of qubits {\$}n{\$}, which prevents us from knowing exactly what teleportation is capable of. In this paper we study the structure of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation at least one maximal abelian subgroup of the {\$}n{\$}-qubit Pauli group into another one. We show that for {\$}n=1,2{\$}, all the {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} gates are semi-Clifford, which is also true for {\$}\backslash{\{}n=3,k=3\backslash{\}}{\$}. However, this is no longer true for {\$}\backslash{\{}n{\textgreater}2,k{\textgreater}3\backslash{\}}{\$}. To measure the capability of this teleportation primitive, we introduce a quantity called `teleportation depth', which characterizes how many teleportation steps are necessary, on average, to implement a given gate. We calculate upper bounds for teleportation depth by decomposing gates into both semi-Clifford {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} gates and those {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}C{\}}{\_}k{\$} gates beyond semi-Clifford operations, and compare their efficiency.},

Decoherence and gate errors lead to wrong estimates of the expectation values of observables used to evaluate the noisy circuit. The two schemes we discuss are deliberately simple and don't require additional qubit resources to be as practically relevant in current experiments as possible. The first method, extrapolation to the zero noise limit, subsequently cancels powers of the noise perturbations by an application of Richardson's deferred approach to the limit. The second method cancel errors by resampling randomized circuits according to a quasi-probability distribution.},

In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time {\$}o(2{\^{}}{\{}n/2{\}}){\$}.

In a first stage, a discrete, universal set of fault-tolerant operations is obtained by error-correcting noisy transformations and distilling resource states. In a second stage, arbitrary transformations are synthesized to desired accuracy by combining elements of this set into a circuit. Here, we present a scheme which merges these two stages into a single one, directly distilling complex transformations. We find that our scheme can reduce the total overhead to realize certain gates by up to a few orders of magnitude.

First we consider sparse quantum circuits such that each qubit participates in O(1) two-qubit gates. It is shown that any sparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}O(k){\}} poly(n){\$}. Secondly, we study Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are non-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The computation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state. This model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show that any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}O(k){\}} poly(n){\$}. Finally, we propose a purely classical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}c n{\}} poly(n){\$} where {\$}c\backslashapprox 0.94{\$}. This improves upon the brute-force simulation method which takes time {\$}2{\^{}}n poly(n){\$}. Our algorithm exploits the fact that n-fold tensor products of magic states admit a low-rank decomposition into n-qubit stabilizer states.},

If the polarization of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65{\%}), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state.

abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that a quantum circuit composed of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Here we revisit this theorem and extend it to quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates, where T is the single-qubit 45-degree phase shift. We assume that the circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits. Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given output x, and (2) sampling x from the output probability distribution. It is shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time {\$}poly(n,m)+2{\^{}}{\{}0.5 t{\}} t{\^{}}3{\$} and {\$}poly(n,m)+2{\^{}}{\{}0.23 t{\}} t{\^{}}3 w{\^{}}4{\$} respectively, where t is the number of T-gates, m is the total number of gates, and n is the number of qubits. The proposed simulation algorithms may serve as a verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear combination of {\$}\backslashchi{\$} stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time {\$}\backslashchi n{\^{}}3 \backslashepsilon{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is the relative error. We also develop techniques for approximating tensor products of "magic states" by linear combinations of stabilizer states. To demonstrate the power of the new simulation methods, we performed a classical simulation of a hidden shift quantum algorithm with 40 qubits, a few hundred Clifford gates, and nearly 50 T-gates.},

abstract = {The standard approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation is to store information in a quantum error correction code, such as the surface code, and process information using a strategy that can be summarized as distill-then-synthesize. In the distill step, one performs several rounds of distillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such magic state provides one good T gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the optimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many T gates interleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood for multiqubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth analysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and multiqubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation protocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This is because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the same number of T-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic error suppression. This general class includes all circuits primarily dominated by control-control-Z gates, such as adders and modular exponentiation routines used in Shor's algorithm. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a costly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional results on the multiqubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient algorithm for synthesizing unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling as optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing controlled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly optimal. We observe that the gate-synthesis cost, measured by T-count, is often strictly subadditive. Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also presented.},

abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

Using this result, I show that several simple changes to the axioms of quantum mechanics would let us solve PP-complete problems efficiently. The result also implies, as an easy corollary, a celebrated theorem of Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman that PP is closed under intersection, as well as a generalization of that theorem due to Fortnow and Reingold. This illustrates that quantum computing can yield new and simpler proofs of major results about classical computation.},

For most quantum algorithms only the quantum Fourier transform of order {\$}2{\^{}}n{\$} is needed, and this can be done exactly. Kitaev $\backslash$cite{\{}kitaev{\}} showed how to approximate the Fourier transform for any order. Here we show how his construction can be made exact by using the technique known as ``amplitude amplification''. Although unlikely to be of any practical use, this construction e.g. allows to make Shor's discrete logarithm quantum algorithm exact. Thus we have the first example of an exact non black box fast quantum algorithm, thereby giving more evidence that ``quantum'' need not be probabilistic. We also show that in a certain sense the family of circuits for the exact QFFT is uniform. Namely the parameters of the gates can be calculated efficiently.},

The magic states are pure non-stabilizer states which can be distilled from certain mixed non-stabilizer states via Clifford group operations alone. Because of the Gottesman-Knill theorem, mixtures of Pauli eigenstates are not expected to be magic state distillable, but it has been an open question whether all mixed states outside this set may be distilled. In this Letter we show that, when resources are finitely limited, non-distillable states exist outside the stabilizer octahedron. In analogy with the bound entangled states, which arise in entanglement theory, we call such states bound states for magic state distillation.},

abstract = {Two-level quantum systems, qubits, are not the only basis for quantum computation. Advantages exist in using qudits, d-level quantum systems, as the basic carrier of quantum information. We show that color codes, a class of topological quantum codes with remarkable transversality properties, can be generalized to the qudit paradigm. In recent developments it was found that in three spatial dimensions a qubit color code can support a transversal non-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional non-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and K$\backslash$"onig's bound [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 170503 (2013)]. Furthermore, by using gauge fixing techniques, an effective set of Clifford gates can be achieved, removing the need for state distillation. We show that the qudit color code can support the qudit analogues of these gates, and show that in higher spatial dimensions a color code can support a phase gate from higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy which can be proven to saturate Bravyi and K$\backslash$"onig's bound in all but a finite number of special cases. The methodology used is a generalisation of Bravyi and Haah's method of triorthogonal matrices [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], which may be of independent interest. For completeness, we show explicitly that the qudit color codes generalize to gauge color codes, and share the many of the favorable properties of their qubit counterparts.},

The problem of minimising the number of gates is known as gate-synthesis. The approximation error is a form of coherent noise, which can be significantly more damaging than comparable incoherent noise. We show how mixing over different gate sequences can convert this coherent noise into an incoherent form. As measured by diamond distance, the post-mixing noise is quadratically smaller than before mixing, with no additional resource cost. Equivalently, we can use a shorter gate sequence to achieve the same precision as unitary gate-synthesis, with a factor 1/2 reduction for a broad class of problems.},

Our result applies to all local-error-detecting quantum codes, that is, all quantum codes capable of detecting an arbitrary error on any single subsystem. An outline of the argument is as follows: The set of logical unitary product operators, G, is a Lie subgroup of the Lie group of unitary product operators, T. As a Lie group, G can be partitioned into cosets of the connected component of the identity, C; these cosets form a discrete set, Q. Using the fact that the Lie algebra of C is a subalgebra of T, it can be shown that the connected component of the identity acts trivially for any local- error-detecting code. This implies that the number of logi- cally distinct operators implemented by elements of G is limited to the cardinality of Q. Because of the compact- ness of T, this number must be finite. A finite number of operators can approximate infinitely many only up to some fixed accuracy; thus, G, the set of logical unitary product operators, cannot be universal. Transversal operators may be viewed as product operators with respect to a transversal partitioning of the code, so the ability to detect an arbitrary error on a transversal part implies the nonexistence of a universal, transversal encoded gate set."},

Since the product results with negator matrix, which can be treated as complex analogue if bistochastic matrix, our method can be seen as complex analogue of Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, where diagonal matrices are replaced by adding and removing an one-qubit ancilla. The decomposition can be found constructively and resulting circuit consists of {\$}O(4{\^{}}k){\$} entangling gates, which is proved to be optimal. An example of such transformation is presented.},

@article{Anders2012,
abstract = {We introduce a new paradigm for quantum computing called Ancilla-Driven Quantum Computation (ADQC) which combines aspects of the quantum circuit (Deutsch, 1989 [1]) and the one-way model (Raussendorf and Briegel, 2001 [2]) to overcome some of the challenging issues in building large-scale quantum computers. Instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal quantum logic gates or measurements, ADQC uses a fixed two-qubit interaction to couple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By measuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system performs the desired logical operations. We characterise all two-qubit interactions which couple any ancilla qubit with any memory qubit, while satisfying certain desirable conditions. We require these interactions to implement unitary, stepwise deterministic and universal evolution. Moreover, it should be possible to standardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the beginning. We prove there are only two such classes of interactions characterised in terms of the non-local part of the interaction operator. This leads to the definition of a new entanglement resource called twisted graph states generated from non-commuting operators. The ADQC model is formalised in an algebraic framework similar to the Measurement Calculus (Danos et al., 2007 [8]). Furthermore, we present the notion of causal flow for twisted graph states, based on the stabiliser formalism, to characterise the determinism. Finally we demonstrate a compositional embedding between ADQC and both the one-way and circuit models which will allow us to transfer recently developed theory and toolkits of measurement-based quantum computing directly into ADQC. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The discovery of quantum error correction has greatly improved the long-term prospects for quantum computing technology. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment, or due to imperfect implementations of quantum logical operations. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. In principle, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. It may be possible to incorporate intrinsic fault tolerance into the design of quantum computing hardware, perhaps by invoking topological Aharonov-Bohm interactions to process quantum information.},

abstract = {Using error correcting codes and fault tolerant techniques, it is possible, at least in theory, to produce logical qubits with significantly lower error rates than the underlying physical qubits. Suppose, however, that the gates that act on these logical qubits are only approximation of the desired gate. This can arise, for example, in synthesizing a single qubit unitary from a set of Clifford and {\$}T{\$} gates; for a generic such unitary, any finite sequence of gates only approximates the desired target. In this case, errors in the gate can add coherently so that, roughly, the error {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} in the unitary of each gate must scale as {\$}\backslashepsilon \backslashlesssim 1/N{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of gates. If, however, one has the option of synthesizing one of several unitaries near the desired target, and if an average of these options is closer to the target, we give some elementary bounds showing cases in which the errors can be made to add incoherently by averaging over random choices, so that, roughly, one needs {\$}\backslashepsilon \backslashlesssim 1/\backslashsqrt{\{}N{\}}{\$}. We remark on one particular application to distilling magic states where this effect happens automatically in the usual circuits.},

abstract = {We determine the cost of performing Shor's algorithm for integer factorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of universal fault tolerant computing on ternary quantum systems: (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability of the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control and (ii) a model based on a metaplectic topological quantum computer (MTQC). Arguably, a natural choice to implement Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to simply emulate the standard binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three level system. In this paper we address this emulation approach and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's period finding function in both models, (i) and (ii).We compare the costs in terms of magic state counts required in each mode and find that a binary emulation implementation of Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer requires slightly smaller circuit depth than the corresponding implementation in the binary Clifford{\$}+T{\$} framework. The reason for this are simplifications for binary arithmetic that can be leveraged over ternary gate sets. We also highlight that magic state preparation on MTQC requires magic state preprocessor of asymptotically smaller size which gives the MTQC solution a significant advantage over the binary framework.},

abstract = {Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance make it possible to perform quantum computations in the presence of imprecision and imperfections of realistic devices. An important question is to find the noise rate at which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed. By concatenating the 7-qubit Steane and 15-qubit Reed-Muller codes, the 105-qubit code enables a universal set of fault-tolerant gates despite not all of them being transversal. Importantly, the CNOT gate remains transversal in both codes, and as such has increased error protection relative to the other single qubit logical gates. We show that while the level-1 pseudo-threshold for the concatenated scheme is limited by the logical Hadamard, the error suppression of the logical CNOT gates allows for the asymptotic threshold to increase by orders of magnitude at higher levels. We establish a lower bound of {\$}1.28{\~{}}\backslashtimes{\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} for the asymptotic threshold of this code which is competitive with known concatenated models and does not rely on ancillary magic state preparation for universal computation.},

Although the overhead required to distill high-fidelity copies of this magic state is high, the subsequent quantum compiling overhead to realize {\$}Z{\$} rotations in a $\backslash$textsc{\{}risc{\}} architecture can be much greater.

As our main result, we show that, if the LU-LC conjecture could be proved for the restricted case of diagonal local unitary operations, then the conjecture is correct in its totality.

abstract = {L1-minimization refers to finding the minimum L1-norm solution to an underdetermined linear system b=Ax. Under certain conditions as described in compressive sensing theory, the minimum L1-norm solution is also the sparsest solution. In this paper, our study addresses the speed and scalability of its algorithms. In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of a sparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, where sparse representation is sought to recover human identities from very high-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facial disguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is a linear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability for large-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classical convex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). The new convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-critical applications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to validate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against several popular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy, FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS. To aid peer evaluation, the code for all the algorithms has been made publicly available.},

abstract = {Decomposing unitaries into a sequence of elementary operations is at the core of quantum computing. Information theoretic arguments show that approximating a random unitary with precision $\epsilon$ requires $\Omega$(log(1/$\epsilon$)) gates. Prior to our work, the state of the art in approximating a single qubit unitary included the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm that requires O(log(3+$\delta$)(1/$\epsilon$)) gates and does not use ancillae and the phase kickback approach that requires O(log(2)(1/$\epsilon$)loglog(1/$\epsilon$)) gates but uses O(log(2)(1/$\epsilon$)) ancillae. Both algorithms feature upper bounds that are far from the information theoretic lower bound. In this Letter, we report an algorithm that saturates the lower bound, and as such it guarantees asymptotic optimality. In particular, we present an algorithm for building a circuit that approximates single qubit unitaries with precision $\epsilon$ using O(log(1/$\epsilon$)) Clifford and T gates and employing up to two ancillary qubits. We connect the unitary approximation problem to the problem of constructing solutions corresponding to Lagrange's four-square theorem, and thereby develop an algorithm for computing an approximating circuit using an average of O(log(2)(1/$\epsilon$)loglog(1/$\epsilon$)) operations with integers.},

In this work, we introduce the notion of $\backslash$emph{\{}asymmetry weight{\}}---an operationally motivated asymmetry quantifier in the resource theory of asymmetry. We study the convexity and monotonicity properties of asymmetry weight and focus on its interplay with the corresponding semidefinite programming (SDP) forms along with its connection to other asymmetry measures. Since the SDP form of asymmetry weight is closely related to asymmetry witnesses, we find that the asymmetry weight can be regarded as a (state-dependent) asymmetry witness. Moreover, some specific entanglement witnesses can be viewed as a special case of an asymmetry witness---which indicates a potential connection between asymmetry and entanglement. We also provide an operationally meaningful coherence measure, which we call $\backslash$emph{\{}coherence weight{\}}, and investigate its relationship to other coherence measures like the robustness of coherence and the {\$}l{\_}1{\$} norm of coherence. In particular, we show that for Werner states in any dimension {\$}d{\$}, all three coherence quantifiers, namely the coherence weight, the robustness of coherence, and the {\$}l{\_}1{\$} norm of coherence are equal and are given by a single letter formula.},

abstract = {Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance have provided the possibility for large scale quantum computations without a detrimental loss of quantum information. A very natural class of gates for fault-tolerant quantum computation is the Clifford gate set and as such their usefulness for universal quantum computation is of great interest. Clifford group gates augmented by magic state preparation give the possibility of simulating universal quantum computation. However, experimentally one cannot expect to perfectly prepare magic states. Nonetheless, it has been shown that by repeatedly applying operations from the Clifford group and measurements in the Pauli basis, the fidelity of noisy prepared magic states can be increased arbitrarily close to a pure magic state [1]. We investigate the robustness of magic state distillation to perturbations of the initial states to arbitrary locations in the Bloch sphere due to noise. Additionally, we consider a depolarizing noise model on the quantum gates in the decoding section of the distillation protocol and demonstrate its effect on the convergence rate and threshold value. Finally, we establish that faulty magic state distillation is more efficient than fault-tolerance-assisted magic state distillation at low error rates due to the large overhead in the number of quantum gates and qubits required in a fault-tolerance architecture. The ability to perform magic state distillation with noisy gates leads us to conclude that this could be a realistic scheme for future small-scale quantum computing devices as fault-tolerance need only be used in the final steps of the protocol.},

abstract = {Quantum circuit synthesis is the process in which an arbitrary unitary operation is decomposed into a sequence of gates from a universal set, typically one which a quantum computer can implement both efficiently and fault-tolerantly. As physical implementations of quantum computers improve, the need is growing for tools which can effectively synthesize components of the circuits and algorithms they will run. Existing algorithms for exact, multi-qubit circuit synthesis scale exponentially in the number of qubits and circuit depth, leaving synthesis intractable for circuits on more than a handful of qubits. Even modest improvements in circuit synthesis procedures may lead to significant advances, pushing forward the boundaries of not only the size of solvable circuit synthesis problems, but also in what can be realized physically as a result of having more efficient circuits. We present a method for quantum circuit synthesis using deterministic walks. Also termed pseudorandom walks, these are walks in which once a starting point is chosen, its path is completely determined. We apply our method to construct a parallel framework for circuit synthesis, and implement one such version performing optimal {\$}T{\$}-count synthesis over the Clifford+{\$}T{\$} gate set. We use our software to present examples where parallelization offers a significant speedup on the runtime, as well as directly confirm that the 4-qubit 1-bit full adder has optimal {\$}T{\$}-count 7 and {\$}T{\$}-depth 3.},

QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using Omega(n{\^{}}2) bits, where n is the number of qubits. Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for: (i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n{\^{}}3) time in general, but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly 4(2{\^{}}n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms to compute the inner product between two such frames.},

@article{Bermejo-Vega2016,
abstract = {(Abridged abstract.) In this thesis we introduce new models of quantum computation to study the emergence of quantum speed-up in quantum computer algorithms. Our first contribution is a formalism of restricted quantum operations, named normalizer circuit formalism, based on algebraic extensions of the qubit Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard and {\$}\backslashpi/4{\$}-phase gates): a normalizer circuit consists of quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs), automorphism gates and quadratic phase gates associated to a set {\$}G{\$}, which is either an abelian group or abelian hypergroup. Though Clifford circuits are efficiently classically simulable, we show that normalizer circuit models encompass Shor's celebrated factoring algorithm and the quantum algorithms for abelian Hidden Subgroup Problems. We develop classical-simulation techniques to characterize under which scenarios normalizer circuits provide quantum speed-ups. Finally, we devise new quantum algorithms for finding hidden hyperstructures. The results offer new insights into the source of quantum speed-ups for several algebraic problems. Our second contribution is an algebraic (group- and hypergroup-theoretic) framework for describing quantum many-body states and classically simulating quantum circuits. Our framework extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism (PSF), wherein quantum states are written as joint eigenspaces of stabilizer groups of commuting Pauli operators: while the PSF is valid for qubit/qudit systems, our formalism can be applied to discrete- and continuous-variable systems, hybrid settings, and anyonic systems. These results enlarge the known families of quantum processes that can be efficiently classically simulated. This thesis also establishes a precise connection between Shor's quantum algorithm and the stabilizer formalism, revealing a common mathematical structure in several quantum speed-ups and error-correcting codes.},

abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a "canonical form" that requires at most O(n{\^{}}2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

abstract = {Communication complexity has become a central complexity model. In that model, we count the amount of communication bits needed between two parties in order to solve certain computational problems. We show that for certain communication complexity problems quantum communication protocols are exponentially faster than classical ones. More explicitly, we give an example for a communication complexity relation (or promise problem) P such that: 1) The quantum communication complexity of P is O(log m). 2) The classical probabilistic communication complexity of P is Omega(m{\^{}}(1/4) / log m). (where m is the length of the inputs). This gives an exponential gap between quantum communication complexity and classical probabilistic communication complexity. Only a quadratic gap was previously known. Our problem P is of geometrical nature, and is a finite precision variation of the following problem: Player I gets as input a unit vector x $\backslash$in R{\^{}}n and two orthogonal subspaces M{\_}0, M{\_}1 $\backslash$subset R{\^{}}n. Player II gets as input an orthogonal matrix T : R{\^{}}n + R{\^{}}n.

abstract = {We show that there are two distinct aspects of a general quantum circuit that can make it hard to efficiently simulate with a classical computer. The first aspect, which has been well-studied, is that it can be hard to efficiently estimate the probability associated with a particular measurement outcome. However, we show that this aspect alone does not determine whether a quantum circuit can be efficiently simulated. The second aspect is that, in general, there can be an exponential number of `relevant' outcomes that are needed for an accurate simulation, and so efficient simulation may not be possible even in situations where the probabilities of individual outcomes can be efficiently estimated. We show that these two aspects are distinct, the former being necessary but not sufficient for simulability whilst the pair is jointly sufficient for simulability. Specifically, we prove that a family of quantum circuits is efficiently simulable if it satisfies two properties: one related to the efficiency of Born rule probability estimation, and the other related to the sparsity of the outcome distribution. We then prove a pair of hardness results (using standard complexity assumptions and a variant of a commonly-used average case hardness conjecture), where we identify families of quantum circuits that satisfy one property but not the other, and for which efficient simulation is not possible. To prove our results, we consider a notion of simulation of quantum circuits that we call epsilon-simulation. This notion is less stringent than exact sampling and is now in common use in quantum hardness proofs.},

abstract = {Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the source of the power in quantum computing has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via 'magic state' distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple 'hidden variable' model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.},

The eigenstates of these operators—stabilizer states—display a structure (e.g., mutual orthogonality relationships) that has made them useful in examples of multi-qubit non-locality and contextuality. Here, we apply the graph-theoretical contextuality formalism of Cabello, Severini and Winter to sets of stabilizer states, with particular attention to the effect of generalizing two-level qubit systems to odd prime d-level qudit systems. While state-independent contextuality using two-qubit states does not generalize to qudits, we show explicitly how state-dependent contextuality associated with a Bell inequality does generalize. Along the way we note various structural properties of stabilizer states, with respect to their orthogonality relationships, which may be of independent interest.},

We consider finite, real or complex frames and rotation or unitarily invariant potentials, and mostly specialize to Parseval frames, meaning the frame potential to be optimized is a function on the manifold of Gram matrices belonging to finite Parseval frames. Next to the known classes of equal-norm and equiangular Parseval frames, we introduce equidistributed Parseval frames, which are more general than the equiangular type but have more structure than equal-norm ones. We also provide examples where this class coincides with that of Grassmannian frames, the minimizers for the maximal magnitude among inner products between frame vectors. These different types of frames are characterized in relation to the optimization of frame potentials. Based on results by Lojasiewicz, we show that the gradient descent for a real analytic frame potential on the manifold of Gram matrices belonging to Parseval frames always converges to a critical point. We then derive geometric structures associated with the critical points of different choices of frame potentials. The optimal frames for families of such potentials are thus shown to be equal-norm, or additionally equipartitioned, or even equidistributed.},

It combines heralded gates previously studied for atom or atom-like qubits with logical encoding from linear optical quantum computation in order to perform high fidelity quantum gates across a quantum network. The error-detecting properties of the heralded operations ensure high fidelity while the encoding makes it possible to correct for failed attempts such that deterministic and high-quality gates can be achieved. Importantly, this is robust to photon loss, which is typically the main obstacle to photonic based quantum information processing. Overall this approach opens a novel path towards quantum networks with atomic nodes and photonic links.},

abstract = {In theory, quantum computers offer a means of solving problems that would be intractable on conventional computers. Assuming that a quantum computer could be constructed, it would in practice be required to function with noisy devices called 'gates'. These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called 'fault-tolerant quantum computing' is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented.},

Among its strengths are the plethora of known ways in which fault-tolerant Clifford operations can be performed, namely, by deforming the topology of the surface, by the fusion and splitting of codes and even by braiding engineered Majorana modes using twist defects. Here we present a unified framework to describe these methods, which is required to better compare different schemes, and to facilitate the design of hybrid schemes. Novel to our unification is the identification of twist defects with the corners of the planar code. This identification enables us to find new ways of performing single-qubit Clifford gates by exchanging the corners of the planar code via code deformation. We analyse the ways in which all of the different schemes can be combined, and propose a novel hybrid encoding. We also show how all of the Clifford gates can be implemented on a single code without loss of distance, thus offering an attractive alternative to ancilla-mediated schemes to complete the Clifford group with lattice surgery.},

abstract = {The ability to detect and deal with errors when manipulating quantum systems is a fundamental requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Unlike classical bits that are subject to only digital bit-flip errors, quantum bits are susceptible to a much larger spectrum of errors, for which any complete quantum error-correcting code must account. Whilst classical bit-flip detection can be realized via a linear array of qubits, a general fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting code requires extending into a higher-dimensional lattice. Here we present a quantum error detection protocol on a two-by-two planar lattice of superconducting qubits. The protocol detects an arbitrary quantum error on an encoded two-qubit entangled state via quantum non-demolition parity measurements on another pair of error syndrome qubits. This result represents a building block towards larger lattices amenable to fault-tolerant quantum error correction architectures such as the surface code.},

In doing so we develop a general approach to distinguishability based on the Schmidt decomposition between particles' "System" and "Label" degrees of freedom, corresponding to what has been called unitary-unitary duality in many-body physics.

This study is motivated by the observation (widely believed but unproven) that classical systems cannot simulate highly entangled quantum systems efficiently, and we hope to hasten the day when well controlled quantum systems can perform tasks surpassing what can be done in the classical world. One way to achieve such "quantum supremacy" would be to run an algorithm on a quantum computer which solves a problem with a super-polynomial speedup relative to classical computers, but there may be other ways that can be achieved sooner, such as simulating exotic quantum states of strongly correlated matter. To operate a large scale quantum computer reliably we will need to overcome the debilitating effects of decoherence, which might be done using "standard" quantum hardware protected by quantum error-correcting codes, or by exploiting the nonabelian quantum statistics of anyons realized in solid state systems, or by combining both methods. Only by challenging the entanglement frontier will we learn whether Nature provides extravagant resources far beyond what the classical world would allow.},

A collection of quantum gates is called universal if it can be used to construct any n-qubit gate. In 1995, the universality of the set of one-qubit gates and controlled NOT gate was shown by Barenco et al. using QR decomposition of unitary matrices. Almost ten years later the decomposition was improved to include essentially fewer elementary gates. In addition, the cosine-sine matrix decomposition was applied to efficiently implement decompositions of general quantum gates. In this chapter, we review the different types of general gate decompositions and slightly improve the best known gate count for the controlled NOT gates to (23/48)4{\^{}}n in the leading order. In physical realizations, the interaction strength between the qubits can decrease strongly as a function of their distance. Therefore, we also discuss decompositions with the restriction to nearest-neighbor interactions in a linear chain of qubits.},

While this is technically true and useful for a physicist, with regards to computation it is an unfortunately narrow point of view. Just as a classical computer can simulate highly nonlinear functions of classical states, so too can the more general quantum computer simulate nonlinear evolutions of quantum states. We detail one particular simulation of nonlinearity on a quantum computer, showing how the entire class of {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\$}-unitary evolutions (on {\$}n{\$} qubits) can be simulated using a unitary, real-amplitude quantum computer (consisting of {\$}n+1{\$} qubits in total). These operators can be represented as the sum of a unitary and antiunitary operator, and add an intriguing new set of nonlinear quantum gates to the toolbox of the quantum algorithm designer. Furthermore, a subgroup of these nonlinear evolutions, called the {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\$}-Cliffords, can be efficiently classically simulated, by making use of the fact that Clifford operators can simulate non-Clifford (in fact, non-linear) operators. This perspective of using the physical operators that we have to simulate non-physical ones that we do not is what we call bottom-up simulation, and we give some examples of its broader implications.},

That same formalism has important applications in the field of quantum error correcting codes, where mixed stabiliser states correspond to projectors on subspaces associated with stabiliser codes. Here, we derive efficient reduction procedures to obtain various useful normal forms for stabiliser states. We explicitly prove that these procedures will always converge to the correct result and that these procedures are efficient in that they only require a polynomial number of operations on the generators of the stabilisers. We obtain two single-party normal forms. The simplest, the row-reduced echelon form, is useful to calculate partial traces of stabiliser states. The second is the fully reduced form and allows for the efficient calculation of the overlap between two stabiliser states, as well as of the Uhlmann fidelity between them, and their Bures distance. We also find a reduction procedure of bipartite stabiliser states, where the operations involved are restricted to be local ones. Using this two-party normal form, we prove that every bipartite mixed stabiliser state is locally equivalent to a direct product of a number of maximally entangled states and a separable state. Using this normal form we can efficiently calculate every reasonable bipartite entanglement measure of mixed stabiliser states.},

abstract = {We study the complexity of approximately evaluating the Ising and Tutte partition functions with complex parameters. Our results are partly motivated by the study of the quantum complexity classes BQP and IQP. Recent results show how to encode quantum computations as evaluations of classical partition functions. These results rely on interesting and deep results about quantum computation in order to obtain hardness results about the difficulty of (classically) evaluating the partition functions for certain fixed parameters. The motivation for this paper is to study more comprehensively the complexity of (classically) approximating the Ising and Tutte partition functions with complex parameters. Partition functions are combinatorial in nature and quantifying their approximation complexity does not require a detailed understanding of quantum computation. Using combinatorial arguments, we give the first full classification of the complexity of multiplicatively approximating the norm and additively approximating the argument of the Ising partition function for complex edge interactions (as well as of approximating the partition function according to a natural complex metric). We also study the norm approximation problem in the presence of external fields, for which we give a complete dichotomy when the parameters are roots of unity. Previous results were known just for a few such points, and we strengthen these results from BQP-hardness to {\#}P-hardness. Moreover, we show that computing the sign of the Tutte polynomial is {\#}P-hard at certain points related to the simulation of BQP. Using our classifications, we then revisit the connections to quantum computation, drawing conclusions that are a little different from (and incomparable to) ones in the quantum literature, but along similar lines.},

abstract = {Recently it was shown that the resources required to implement unitary operations on a quantum computer can be reduced by using probabilistic quantum circuits called repeat-until-success (RUS) circuits. However, the previously best-known algorithm to synthesize a RUS circuit for a given target unitary requires exponential classical runtime. We present a probabilistically polynomial-time algorithm to synthesize a RUS circuit to approximate any given single-qubit unitary to precision e over the Clifford + T basis. Surprisingly, the T count of the synthesized RUS circuit surpasses the theoretical lower bound of 3 log(2)(1/epsilon) that holds for purely unitary single-qubit circuit decomposition. By taking advantage of measurement and an ancilla qubit, RUS circuits achieve an expected T count of 1.15 log (2)(1/epsilon) for singlequbit z rotations. Our method leverages the fact that the set of unitaries implementable by RUS protocols has a higher density in the space of all unitaries compared to the density of purely unitary implementations.},

abstract = {The essential insight of quantum error correction was that quantum information can be protected by suitably encoding this quantum information across multiple independently erred quantum systems. Recently it was realized that, since the most general method for encoding quantum information is to encode it into a subsystem, there exists a novel form of quantum error correction beyond the traditional quantum error correcting subspace codes. These new quantum error correcting subsystem codes differ from subspace codes in that their quantum correcting routines can be considerably simpler than related subspace codes. Here we present a class of quantum error correcting subsystem codes constructed from two classical linear codes. These codes are the subsystem versions of the quantum error correcting subspace codes which are generalizations of Shor's original quantum error correcting subspace codes. For every Shor-type code, the codes we present give a considerable savings in the number of stabilizer measurements needed in their error recovery routines.},

abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA can exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing quantum supremacy.},

The robustness of magic was recently proposed as a well-behaved magic monotone for multi-qubit states and quantifies the simulation overhead of circuits composed of Clifford+T gates, or circuits using other gates from the Clifford hierarchy. Here we present a general theory of the "non-stabiliserness" of quantum operations rather than states, which are useful for classical simulation of more general circuits. We introduce two magic monotones, called channel robustness and magic capacity, which are well-defined for general n-qubit channels and treat all stabiliser-preserving CPTP maps as free operations. We present two complementary Monte Carlo-type classical simulation algorithms with sample complexity given by these quantities and provide examples of channels where the complexity of our algorithms is exponentially better than previous known simulators. We present additional techniques that ease the difficulty of calculating our monotones for special classes of channels.},

It is shown that the problem is NP-hard, but that the well-known greedy heuristic is good in that it computes a solution with at most [18 Opt(6/Z)llA + I1 ln(llbl12/6)] non-zero entries, where Opt(6/2) is the optimum number of nonzero entries at error 6/2, A is the matrix obtained by normalizing each column of A with respect to the L2 norm, and A + is its pseudo-inverse. 1. Introduction. The problem of computing a sparse approximate solution to a linear system is a fundamental problem in matrix computation. For matrices over the reals, the problem (variant thereof) has been studied under the name "subset selection" in statistical modeling by Golub and Van Loan (1983). For binary matrices, the problem has been studied as "minimum weight solution" in error corrective coding by Gallager (1968). The related "sparse null-space" problem is of interest in nonlinear optimization; see Coleman and Pothen (1986). Also, the "minimum set cover" problem can be viewed as computing a sparse solution to Ax {\textgreater}{\_} b, where all the entries are binary and the inequality is entry-wise; see Garey and Johnson (1979), Johnson (1974). Our specific motivation for studying the problem is as follows. A widely used technique for the interpolation of irregularly spaced samples in higher dimensions is that of radial basis interpolation; see Hardy (1988). In brief, assign each of the given sample points a coefficient. The value of the interpolant at a new point is the weighted sum of these coefficients, where the weights are the distances of the respective samples from the new point. The coefficients themselves are the solution to the linear system of equations obtained by evaluating the in-terpolant at the each of the given points and equating them to the respective sample values; Michelli (1986) has shown that the linear system is always nonsingular. In solving the above linear system, two issues are of interest. (1) The cost of evaluating the interpolant at a general point grows with the number of nonzero coefficients in the solution. Hence, it is desirable to have as few nonzeros as possible, while tolerating some error in the interpolation. (2) By the principle of Occam's Razor, the interpolant with the fewest nonzero},

Combined with the Clifford group, either of these two gates generate a universal set. Here, we combine these two features by demonstrating how to fault-tolerantly convert between these two codes, providing a new method to realize universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. One interpretation of our result is that both codes correspond to the same subsystem code in different gauges. Our scheme extends to the entire family of quantum Reed-Muller codes.},

We present circuit-level schemes for extracting the error syndrome of these codes fault-tolerantly. We further present an integer-program-based decoding algorithm for identifying the most likely error given the syndrome. We simulated our syndrome extraction and decoding algorithms against three physically-motivated noise models using Monte Carlo methods, and used the simulations to estimate the corresponding accuracy thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. We also used a self-avoiding walk analysis to lower-bound the accuracy threshold for two of these noise models. We present and analyze two architectures for fault-tolerantly computing with these codes: one with 2D arrays of qubits are stacked atop each other and one in a single 2D substrate. Our analysis demonstrates that color codes perform slightly better than Kitaev's surface codes when circuit details are ignored. When these details are considered, we estimate that color codes achieve a threshold of 0.082(3){\%}, which is higher than the threshold of {\$}1.3 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} achieved by concatenated coding schemes restricted to nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions but lower than the threshold of 0.75{\%} to 1.1{\%} reported for the Kitaev codes subject to the same restrictions. Finally, because the behavior of our decoder's performance for two of the noise models we consider maps onto an order-disorder phase transition in the three-body random-bond Ising model in 2D and the corresponding random-plaquette gauge model in 3D, our results also answer the Nishimori conjecture for these models in the negative: the statistical-mechanical classical spin systems associated to the 4.8.8 color codes are counterintuitively more ordered at positive temperature than at zero temperature.},

abstract = {A short introduction to quantum error correction is given, and it is shown that zero-dimensional quantum codes can be represented as self-dual additive codes over GF(4) and also as graphs. We show that graphs representing several such codes with high minimum distance can be described as nested regular graphs having minimum regular vertex degree and containing long cycles. Two graphs correspond to equivalent quantum codes if they are related by a sequence of local complementations. We use this operation to generate orbits of graphs, and thus classify all inequivalent self-dual additive codes over GF(4) of length up to 12, where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known. We show that these codes can be interpreted as quadratic Boolean functions, and we define non-quadratic quantum codes, corresponding to Boolean functions of higher degree. We look at various cryptographic properties of Boolean functions, in particular the propagation criteria. The new aperiodic propagation criterion (APC) and the APC distance are then defined. We show that the distance of a zero-dimensional quantum code is equal to the APC distance of the corresponding Boolean function. Orbits of Boolean functions with respect to the {\{}I,H,N{\}}{\^{}}n transform set are generated. We also study the peak-to-average power ratio with respect to the {\{}I,H,N{\}}{\^{}}n transform set (PAR{\_}IHN), and prove that PAR{\_}IHN of a quadratic Boolean function is related to the size of the maximum independent set over the corresponding orbit of graphs. A construction technique for non-quadratic Boolean functions with low PAR{\_}IHN is proposed. It is finally shown that both PAR{\_}IHN and APC distance can be interpreted as partial entanglement measures.},

abstract = {Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past five years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined with extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this technology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many, the first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the cloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet. Recently IBM has released the {\{}$\backslash$em Quantum Experience{\}} which allows users to access a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this online availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum information experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise the IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum Arithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by accessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject to significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This demonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a wider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in quantum information technology.},

Contrary to previous methods, which usually solve this problem by minimizing the L1 norm using Linear Programming (LP) techniques, our algorithm tries to directly minimize the L0 norm. It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm is about two to three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art interior-point LP solvers, while providing the same (or better) accuracy.},

We show how each Clifford circuit can be reduced to an equivalent, manifestly simulatable circuit (normal form). This provides a simple proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem without resorting to stabilizer techniques. The normal form highlights why Clifford circuits have such limited computational power in spite of their high entangling power. At the same time, the normal form shows how the classical simulation of Clifford circuits fits into the standard way of embedding classical computation into the quantum circuit model. This leads to simple extensions of Clifford circuits which are classically simulatable. These circuits can be efficiently simulated by classical sampling ('weak simulation') even though the problem of exactly computing the outcomes of measurements for these circuits ('strong simulation') is proved to be {\#}P-complete--thus showing that there is a separation between weak and strong classical simulation of quantum computation.},

abstract = {Magic state distillation (MSD) is a purification protocol that plays a central role in fault tolerant quantum computation. Repeated iteration of the steps of a MSD protocol, generates pure single non-stabilizer states, or magic states, from multiple copies of a mixed resource state using stabilizer operations only. Thus mixed resource states promote the stabilizer operations to full universality. Magic state distillation was introduced for qubit-based quantum computation, but little has been known concerning MSD in higher dimensional qudit-based computation. Here, we describe a general approach for studying MSD in higher dimensions. We use it to investigate the features of a qutrit MSD protocol based on the 5-qutrit stabilizer code. We show that this protocol distills non-stabilizer magic states, and identify two types of states, that are attractors of this iteration map. Finally, we show how these states may be converted, via stabilizer circuits alone, into a state suitable for state injected implementation of a non-Clifford phase gate, enabling non-Clifford unitary computation.},

We show that color codes, a class of topological quantum codes with remarkable transversality properties, can be generalized to the qudit paradigm. In recent developments it was found that in three spatial dimensions a qubit color code can support a transversal non-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional non-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and K$\backslash$"onig's bound [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 170503 (2013)]. Furthermore, by using gauge fixing techniques, an effective set of Clifford gates can be achieved, removing the need for state distillation. We show that the qudit color code can support the qudit analogues of these gates, and show that in higher spatial dimensions a color code can support a phase gate from higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy which can be proven to saturate Bravyi and K$\backslash$"onig's bound in all but a finite number of special cases. The methodology used is a generalisation of Bravyi and Haah's method of triorthogonal matrices [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], which may be of independent interest.
